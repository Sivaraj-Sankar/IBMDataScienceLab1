Lab1 - Simple Linear Regression
* Using Simple Linear Regression Predicting the CO2 Gas Emission from the Car.
* Using Out-of-Samples predicting the test results and identifying the accuracy of the score.
* Evaluating the Model with Mean Square Error(MSE metrics) and R2 score (Residual Sum of Square).

Lab2 - Multiple Linear Regression
* Predicting the CO2 Gas Emission using the various Car features like engine size, no of clyinders etc,
* Using Out-of-Samples method predicting the target value - CO2 Gas Emission and calculating the accuracy of the score.
* Evaluating the Model with MSE metrics and R2 score.
